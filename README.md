memorygame
==========

This is a very simple memory based game. The player will be presented with 9
images in grid of 3X3. This grid will be visible for 15 seconds. Once 15
seconds are passed all the images will be flipped. At the bottom one image will
be shown to player. The player has to guess the location if the image. If the
image matches with the one at bottom then the image will continue to be
displayed otherwise it will flipped back and player has to do another guess.
Once all images are identified the game will be over.
